Weather API Homework Assignment
I have spent about 35 hours building this wearther api.I think the final result is good,I plan to add more features in the near future,perhaps an api call that provides realtime video of queried city or a famous land mark.I feel that I uded too many if else statements, perhaps there is a more efficient way.The weather dashboard fulfills all the criteria and I added the color code uv index to the five day forcst a well.  I also added a clear input field on focus for the text box and a location,reload to clear the previous output results on a new search button click as I didndt really know how to do that.The 2 things together work ok but not 100% how I wanted.

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://bitcoin507.github.io/Weather-API/

Here are 2 screenshots to the deployed app
